# FinCompare Front-end Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to let the developer show familiarity and skills with frontend technologies by creating a simple app using what its judges best, regarding patterns, libraries, and architeture.


## The Challenge

We'll use the [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) to create a single page application that
presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until
2015. Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for
the selected year. We also request to highlight the row when the winner
has been the world champion in the same season.

Feel free to create the UI the way you think it's best, just make sure it's clean, understandable and it's a single page application. The main goal here is to check your skills with CSS or whatever you use to style your project.

## Delivery

Please use Github to send us your challenge, if you could fork this repo would be even better.

## Extra

- You can use any Javascript library you want, but we would rather if you use React
- Write a readme file explaining4 what you did, what you used and how to run your project.
